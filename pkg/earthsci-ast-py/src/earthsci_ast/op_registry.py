"""Canonical registry of the ESM expression-AST ``op`` vocabulary.

This module is the **single source of truth** for the set of ``op`` strings that
may appear on an :class:`~earthsci_ast.esm_types.ExprNode`. It exists because the
vocabulary was previously implicit, scattered across at least six independent
tables / dispatch chains that could (and did) drift apart:

* :mod:`earthsci_ast.expression` — ``_UNARY_SYMPY`` / ``_BINARY_SYMPY`` (ESM→SymPy)
  and the ``_FROM_SYMPY_*`` reverse tables.
* :mod:`earthsci_ast.display` — the operator-precedence map plus the big
  render dispatch (``_format_structural_op`` + ``_format_expression_node``).
* :mod:`earthsci_ast.codegen` — the Julia and Python ``op → handler`` chains.
* :mod:`earthsci_ast.numpy_interpreter` — ``_SCALAR_FUNCS`` / ``_CMP_UFUNCS`` /
  ``_broadcast_fn`` and the ``eval_expr`` dispatch.
* :mod:`earthsci_ast.cadence` — ``RELATIONAL_OPS`` (the value-invention guard).

The historical failure mode (flagged by the Python audit): when a new op is
added it raises loudly in the SymPy path but **silently degrades** to generic
``op(args)`` rendering in ``display`` / ``codegen`` — no error, just wrong-looking
output. The registry, together with ``tests/test_op_registry.py``, closes that
gap: the test asserts each renderer/dispatcher stays in sync with this registry,
so adding an op to the registry without updating a renderer fails loudly at test
time. (``display`` / ``codegen`` do NOT warn at runtime: an op reaching the
generic ``op(args)`` fallback is either an evaluable-core function that renders
correctly as a call — ``sin(x)`` — or an open-tier rewrite-target op that is a
legitimate document element lowered before evaluation. Both are correct outputs,
so neither a registered sugar op like ``grad`` nor an unregistered custom op like
``godunov_hamiltonian`` is privileged over the other — they render identically.)

**Contract for renderers/dispatchers.** Every op below is part of the accepted
vocabulary. A renderer/dispatcher is expected to cover the subset appropriate to
its role (see the per-table scoping in ``tests/test_op_registry.py``).

This registry is the **single source** for the op VOCABULARY and each op's arity
bounds: the pure op-SET tables now DERIVE their contents from it rather than
re-authoring them, so drift is impossible by construction —
``structural_checks._OPERATOR_ARITY`` (:func:`arity_bounds_map`),
``cadence.RELATIONAL_OPS`` (``by_category("relational")``), ``esm_types.ARRAY_OPS``
(``by_category("array") | by_category("geometry")``), and ``codegen._COMPARISON_OPS``.
The heterogeneous VALUE tables keep their local values (a SymPy class, a numpy
ufunc, a target-language spelling, a precedence int — none of which may enter this
sympy/numpy-free leaf) but derive their KEY SETS from the registry categories:
``expression._UNARY_SYMPY`` / ``_BINARY_SYMPY`` and
``numpy_interpreter._SCALAR_FUNCS`` / ``_CMP_UFUNCS`` (via :func:`unary_elementary`,
:func:`by_category`, :func:`canonical_names`). The remaining per-op VALUE maps whose
key sets are NOT a clean registry category — ``codegen._INFIX_SEP`` / ``_CALL_NAME``
and ``display``'s precedence map — stay hand-authored and are cross-checked here.

**Derivation.** The set is the union of esm-spec.md §4.2's op vocabulary and
every one of the six tables above (read exhaustively). It is intentionally the
honest union, so accepted spelling aliases (``**`` / ``pow`` for ``^``; ``=`` for
``==``) are included and marked via :attr:`OpSpec.alias_of`.

Categories
----------

``arithmetic``       ``+ - * / ^`` (and the ``**`` / ``pow`` spellings)
``elementary``       spec §4.2 "Elementary Functions": exp/log/trig/hyperbolic
                     families, ``atan2``, ``min``/``max``, ``floor``/``ceil``,
                     ``abs``, ``sign``
``comparison``       ``> < >= <= == !=`` (and the ``=`` equality spelling)
``logical``          ``and`` / ``or`` / ``not`` and the ``true`` / ``false``
                     boolean literals
``conditional``      ``ifelse``
``calculus``         ``D`` (structural time-derivative LHS) and ``ic``
``event``            ``Pre``
``closed_registry``  ``fn`` / ``enum`` / ``table_lookup`` (spec §4.4/§4.5/§9.5)
``template``         ``apply_expression_template`` (spec §9.6)
``constant``         ``const`` (inline literal)
``array``            aggregate/makearray/index/broadcast/reshape/transpose/concat
``relational``       value-invention & index-returning reducers: skolem, rank,
                     argmin, argmax, distinct, join (RFC semiring-faq-unified-ir)
``geometry``         intersect_polygon, polygon_intersection_area (§8.6 kernels)

The open-tier rewrite-target sugar (grad/div/laplacian/curl/integral, esm-spec
§4.2) is intentionally **NOT** registered: those ops carry no dimensional rule,
no evaluator, no privileged arity, and are not used for spatial detection, so
they are ordinary unregistered rewrite-target ops indistinguishable from a
custom user op (``godunov_hamiltonian``). ``integral``'s ∫ rendering reads its
own ``var``/``lower``/``upper`` sidecar fields via a structural ``op ==
"integral"`` branch in :mod:`.display`, which needs no registry entry.

Tiers
-----

``core``            evaluable-core (closed) op — every binding's evaluator
                    implements it directly (esm-spec §4.2). Every registered op
                    is ``core`` (the default).
``rewrite_target``  open-tier op with **no** evaluator; it MUST be eliminated by
                    a rewrite rule before evaluation (``unlowered_operator`` if
                    not, esm-spec §9.6.6). Every rewrite-target op — the sugar
                    (grad/div/…) and any custom op — is UNregistered, a
                    rewrite-target by virtue of not being evaluable-core; the tier
                    label is retained in :data:`TIERS` for that vocabulary.

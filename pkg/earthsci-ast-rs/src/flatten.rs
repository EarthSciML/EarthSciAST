//! Coupled system flattening per spec §4.7.5 + §4.7.6 (Rust Core tier).
//!
//! This module implements [`flatten`] — the canonical pipeline that turns an
//! [`EsmFile`] with multiple coupled components into a single [`FlattenedSystem`]
//! with dot-namespaced variables and real [`Expr`]-tree equations.
//!
//! The Rust implementation targets the **Core tier** only. It does NOT inspect
//! `dimension_mapping` declarations at all: there is no `slice` / `project` /
//! `regrid` handling, and no dimension-promotion graph is built. The
//! dimension-mapping error variants ([`FlattenError::UnsupportedMapping`],
//! [`FlattenError::DimensionPromotion`], [`FlattenError::UnmappedDomain`],
//! [`FlattenError::DomainUnitMismatch`], [`FlattenError::DomainExtentMismatch`])
//! and [`DimensionPromotionRecord`] are reserved for cross-language parity —
//! defined so a sibling binding (or a future Rust tier) can raise / populate
//! them under the same names, but never currently constructed by this crate.
//! Unlowered rewrite-target operators (the sugar ops
//! `grad` / `div` / `laplacian` / `curl` / `∇`, or a spatial `D` with
//! `wrt != "t"`) raise [`FlattenError::UnloweredOperator`] with the uniform
//! `unlowered_operator` code (esm-spec §4.2 / §9.6.8): they must first be
//! discretized into an `arrayop` stencil by a `match` rewrite rule (an
//! `expression_templates` discretization, applied during the load-time rewrite
//! fixpoint). Once discretized, the spatial axis folds into the array index
//! (`independent_variables == ["t"]`) and the system simulates natively through
//! the array-op backend — Rust runs discretized PDEs alongside Julia and Python
//! (CONFORMANCE_SPEC §5.9). The error fires only for a spatial operator that
//! reached flatten without being discretized.
